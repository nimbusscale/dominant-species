Via the setGameState method which will takes an entire GameState object and overwrites the previous GameState object. All observables\nwill then emit the values from the new GameState object. This method is typically used when the GameState is updated based on a received GSP.\n2.) Via a transaction, which is typically done via actions taken during a turn. In this case, the startTransaction method is called and\nthe state is updated via calling one or more set methods (such as setPile) and then calling commitTransaction or rollbackTransaction.\nIn Either case, all observables will then emit the values from the new GameState object. This is to ensure that all local objects have the\ncurrent GameState.\n\n            \n\n\n\n            \n    Index\n    \n        \n                \n                    \n

and GameStateStoreService provides observables for each of those keys.\n * So if someone was interested in the pile key, then they could subscribe to the pile$ observable.\n * A value will be emitted on each observable whenever the GameState is updated, regardless of if the particular key has been updated.\n *\n * The GameState can be updated in one of two ways:\n *\n * 1.) Via the setGameState method which will takes an entire GameState object and overwrites the previous GameState object. All observables\n * will then emit the values from the new GameState object. This method is typically used when the GameState is updated based on a received GSP.\n *\n * 2.) Via a transaction, which is typically done via actions taken during a turn. In this case, the startTransaction method is called and\n * the state is updated via calling one or more set methods (such as setPile) and then calling commitTransaction or rollbackTransaction.\n * In Either case, all observables will then emit the values from the new GameState object.
