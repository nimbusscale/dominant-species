## Player and Faction
A player is a person that makes decisions and takes actions in the game. Players control a faction and actions taken by a player are done under the guise of a faction. Generally, there is a one-to-one relationship between a player and a faction, and that is the case in DS where each player controls a faction that is an animal (Mammal, Bird, Insect, Etc). Factions interact with the game and players control factions.

In many games, the faction is only identified by a player's color, so a player may control the blue or red faction. Most games a player controls the same faction for the entire game, but that is not the case for all games. For example, in Imperial, the control of each player can change over the course of the game and a single player can control multiple factions.

## Area and Space
An area represents a board or part of a board on a table, and each area contains one or more spaces. A space is a place where an action can interact with an area. These interactions are typically putting or removing a piece (see below for more details on pieces). An area can be shared, such as the game board, or owned by a faction, such as a player's tableau.

Typically, all spaces in an area share the same behavior. As an example, DS would have the following area and spaces:

- Earth which is what DS calls the hex gird area of the board. The Earth area contains spaces where the hex tiles are places.
- Terrain tile area which contains three spaces each with a deck of terrain tiles and one space containing the tundra tiles. These are the tiles that are used by a faction when performing Wanderlust. The terrain tiles are removed from the deck in one of the terrain tile area's spaces and placed in one of the Earth area's spaces.
- Action display area contains the spaces that a faction's action pawn (a type of piece) is placed on and then removed when the faction takes the corresponding action.
- Dominance card deck area and dominance card display areas. Where the dominance card deck area has a single space containing the dominance card deck and the dominance card display area containing five spaces, each containing a face up dominance card. The dominance card deck area and the dominance card display area are separated into two different areas because their spaces work differently. One holding a deck and the other holding face up cards.
- Animal faction areas where each animal faction in the game has an area owned by and related to that animal faction. This area has spaces used to store the elements which can be added or removed from an animal.

## Piece, Pile and Deck
A piece is an object typically placed or removed from a space as the result of an action. Pieces can be owned by a faction, such as an action pawn, or can be unowned like a terrain tile.

In most cases, pieces are stored in either a:

- Deck which is an ordered sequence of pieces. When a piece is removed from a deck, typically the piece at the top of (i.e. first in the sequence) is removed. Decks are always finite and new pieces can be added to the top or bottom of a deck. Decks can also be shuffled to randomly rearrange the order of the pieces in the deck. Examples of decks in DS would be the terrain tile deck or dominance card deck.
- Pile which is an unordered pool of pieces. When a piece is removed from a pile, a random piece is removed. Piles can either be finite or infinite. Examples of piles in DS would be the element draw pool which represents the draw bag in the physical game, and each animal has one pile of species (i.e. the cubes) and one pile of action pawns.
